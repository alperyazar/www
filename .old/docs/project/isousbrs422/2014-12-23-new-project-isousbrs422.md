# New Project: isoUSBRS422, Isolated USB RS422 Converter

![isoUSBRS422 PCB](img/2014-12-23-isoUSBRS422_ver1_cs.png)

I have just ordered PCBs of my new project: **isoUSBRS422**. It is an isolated USB â†” RS422 board. I am very excited about process because it will be my first (real) open source hardware (not OSHW licensed) and KiCad project. Hopefully, it will work :)

Image at the top is created by Gerber files by [ZofzPCB](../../nb/r/zofzpcb.md) not a real picture. Hopefully, soldermask will be dark as shown.

Some time ago, I saw a Italy map at silkscreen on bottom layer of one Arduino board. So, I decided to put a Turkey map to see how it looks like, not for nationalism. I hope, resolution of silkscreen layer will be good enough.

At that moment, it is in production stage at board house.

Stay tuned! :)

*Dangerous Prototypes*

Vow! Another great news after [isoUSBRS422 is on EEVblog "Mailbag" (+my comments)](2015-12-26-isousbrs422-is-on-eevblog-mailbag.md) post.
[Dangerous Prototypes](http://www.dangerousprototypes.com/) which is one of the best sites about electronics and open source hardware projects is kind enough to mention about [isoUSBRS422](index.md) project.

Many thanks to DP. I am glad to see my project on such a reputable blog.

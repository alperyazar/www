# byzantine failure

Byzantine failures are characterized by undetected erroneous computation ( opposite of fail fast (with an error or no result)). They are "sneaky" errors. "erroneous" can be "malicious" because one can abuse it. They are very difficult to detect and confine. It is a real problem in distributed systems (may be like blockcahin :)).
Avoidance is the best solution. [@lamport1982byzantine][^1f]

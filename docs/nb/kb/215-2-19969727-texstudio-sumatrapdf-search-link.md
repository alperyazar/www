# Create Search Link Between TeXstudio and SumatraPDF (215-2-19969727)

I use [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/) for my LaTeX works. [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html) is also good, lightweight PDF reader. It is possible to create a forward search from TeXstudio to SumatraPDF. You may find PDF output of a LaTeX code. Similarly, a backward search is possible: find LaTeX source code from PDF output.

Given steps are tested by using **TeXstudio 2.10.8** and **SumatraPDF v3.1.1 64-bit** on a **Windows 7 64-bit** machine. However, I am pretty sure it will work for almost all possible future and previous versions.

!!! info
    This post will be based on [this article](http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/texstudio-sumatrapdf/) But since it was published in 2011, there are some slight changes in software menus. You may also read it.

1- Open TexStudio. Navigate **Options** → **Configure TeXstutdio…**

![Configure TeXstudio…](/img/kb/215-2-19969727-a.png)

*Configure TeXstudio…*

2- Click **Commands** tab, and find **External PDF Viewer** option.

*External PDF Viewer…*

3- Change the field with:

```text
"C:/Program Files (x86)/SumatraPDF/SumatraPDF.exe" -reuse-instance %.pdf
```

You should put **your** path to SumatraPDF.exe between quotation marks.

!!! info
    **Update (08 Feb 2015):** I use pdflatex. According to Vojtech Vozda (see comments), if you use DVI → PS → PDF chain you should also add -synctex=1 option to LaTeX part as in PdfLaTeX option in order to create search link between your source code and PDF file. See also: [What exactly is SyncTeX?](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/118489/what-exactly-is-synctex)

4- Click **Build** tab, find **PDF Viewer** option and change it to **External PDF Viewer.**

![Use External PDF Viewer](/img/kb/215-2-19969727-c.png)

*Use External PDF Viewer*

5- On the same windows, locate **User Commands** tab.

![User Commands](/img/kb/215-2-19969727-d.png)

*User Commands*

Add the following statements:

```text
user0:Forward Search
```

to the first column and

```text
dde:///"C:/Program Files (x86)/SumatraPDF/SumatraPDF.exe":SUMATRA/control/  [ForwardSearch("?am.pdf","?c:am.tex",@,0,0,1)]
```

You should put **your** path to SumatraPDF.exe between quotation marks.

Click **OK**

6- Now let’s open **Options** → **Configure TeXstutdio…** again and select **Shortcuts** tab. Expand **Menus** → **Tools** → **User** tree. Now you should see a user command called **Forward Search**. Now its default shortcut is **Alt+Shift+F1**. But you can also assign another shortcut to forward search like **F2**. But this step is optional.

7- Now we are done with TeXstudio. Let’s set up SumatraPDF. Open SumatraPDF. Click **Settings** → **Options**.

![Sumatra Settings](/img/kb/215-2-19969727-f.png)

*Sumatra Settings*

8- Locate **Set inverse search command-line**.

!!! info
    **Update (19 Feb 2016):** 8.a is added.

8.a- If you don’t see “Set inverse search command-line” option and options window is ended by “SumatraPDF is your default PDF reader” button, first do this step.

Run the following command. (Windows Start → Search for cmd.exe → Open cmd.exe → Paste the following code → Press Enter)

```text
"C:/Program Files (x86)/SumatraPDF/SumatraPDF.exe" -inverse-search
```

You should put **your** path to SumatraPDF.exe between quotation marks.

This command will open SumatraPDF but it will give a loading error. This isn’t important. Now open options again and you should see the inverse search option as given below.

![Sumatra Inverse Search](/img/kb/215-2-19969727-g.png)

*Sumatra Inverse Search*

Type:

```text
"C:\Program Files (x86)\TeXstudio\texstudio.exe" "%f" -line %l
```

You should put **your** path to SumatraPDF.exe between quotation marks.

Click **OK** and exit.

Now **let’s try your new setup.**

Compile a LaTeX code in TeXstudio and produce PDF output. If you press **F2** (if you assign that shortcut in TeXstudio settings), SumatraPDF should highlight corresponding output of your cursor position. In SumatraPDF, double-clicking shows corresponding LaTeX code in TeXstudio.

# awk: symbol lookup error: awk: undefined symbol: mpfr_z_sub (215-2-04450656)

## Symptoms

Running TCL script of a **Vivado 2016.4** project on **Ubuntu 16.04 (.6) LTS** emits this error. It looks like a bug in Vivado 2016.4 which is triggered while running on Ubuntu. There are possible solutions. My solution doesnâ€™t look like the best one but it works.

## Solution

Open `bin/loader` file located at Vivado installation directory, for example `... Vivado/2016.4/bin/loader`. Find the following code around **line 420**.

```bash
OS=$(awk '/DISTRIB_ID=/' /etc/*-release | sed 's/DISTRIB_ID=//' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
```

Comment the line and add a one line command as follows.

```bash
#OS=$(awk '/DISTRIB_ID=/' /etc/*-release | sed 's/DISTRIB_ID=//' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
OS="ubuntu"
```

By doing this we are assigning variable OS directly. If you execute the problematic line at shell, you will get `ubuntu` as expected. However AFAIK `awk` command executed at `bin/loader` script is different than the command executed at command line due to include order of the script.

This solution works but the solution given [there](https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Installation-and-Licensing/Vivado-2016-4-on-Ubuntu-16-04-LTS-quot-awk-symbol-lookup-error/m-p/756779/highlight/true#M17778) may be a better solution.

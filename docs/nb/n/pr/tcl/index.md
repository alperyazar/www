# Tcl Notes

This is the home page of my Tcl notes. My main Tcl usage is limited to basic
scripting for EDA tools like Vivado. Notes (will) cover(s) basic Tcl.

Tcl is an interpreted language like Python. I will use version 8.6. Although
some resources target version 8.5 and there are some major changes
like built-in OOP support between two versions [^1f], in my case (using as a simple scripting
language) this shouldn't be a problem. Tcl 8.5(.19) is last updated on 2016 [^2f]
and Tcl 8.0 ways back to 1999 [^3f].

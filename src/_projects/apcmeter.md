This project is just for fun. It is used to monitor CPU and RAM usage of a
computer via vintage looking illuminated gauges. aPCmeter uses Arduino Nano v3
as controller. It is completely an open source project and you can build your
aPCmeter easily. All building steps and internals of Arduino software are
explained in detail.

Here is the aPCmeter in a nutshell:

# What is aPCmeter?

Actually there is nothing more to say about the project. You saw the pictures
and features. It is a project just for fun. **aPCmeter** can be considered as
**a PCmeter** or **alper’s PCmeter** or **analog PCmeter**.

aPCmeter provides a COM port based communication interface to PC. It possible to
adjust gauge positions and brightness of LEDs over this interface. aPCmeter
can’t detect CPU and RAM usage of computer itself. A proper computer software
should drive aPCmeter hardware (LEDs and gauges). aPCmeter works like a *slave*
device.

Initially I saw Analog PC Stats Meter project on the web
([http://www.lungstruck.com/projects/pc-meter/](http://www.lungstruck.com/projects/pc-meter/))
then I decided to build my own based on this idea.

aPCmeter project consists of only hardware components + Arduino software. No
computer software is given with this project (unlike Analog PC Stats Meter
project). On the other hand, a computer software must run to get CPU and RAM
utilization information from operating system and send it to the aPCmeter. I
will publish that software under different project name. You can consider
aPCmeter as missing. But you can write your simple PC software because
communication protocol of aPCmeter is described in detail. I will update this
section after publishing the computer software (I hope that I will remember to
update).

AS IS, ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. TAKE YOUR OWN RISK
{: .notice--warning}

If you build your own aPCmeter just download files from Github (link is given at
the top) and follow the steps given in `HowToBuild` folder. I prepared very
detailed document. If you have any problem, you can contact me always.

Status: completed, abandoned
{: .notice--info}

This is a simple programmer for SST brand BIOS EEPROMs for my [İBTÇ]({%
link _projects/ibtc.md %}) project. Although I completed the project, I haven't
any time to publish it for that moment. It is highly likely that I will never
publish it. That's why I tagged as "abandoned".

This is an automation script written in Python 2 to add periodicals to an
Calibre library. As an electronics engineer, I am trying to follow and read some
electronics related e-magazines. I am using
[Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) to store and categorize them. If you
havenâ€™t heard of Calibre, you should check out it. I wrote this script to add
issues of magazines to my Calibre library according to their file names
automatically.

Files are published on GitHub and the link is just given below. You may download
from that page.

# Abstract

This paper proposes a scalable on-chip packet switch architecture,
ACCLOUD-SWITCH, for hardware accelerated cloud data centers. The proposed switch
architecture adopts architectural features from high-speed computer network and
network on chip (NoC) routers. ACCLOUD-SWITCH interconnects heterogeneous
high-speed interfaces and is implemented on FPGA. The switch fabric runs at line
speed for scalability. We propose a new work-conserving fabric arbiter that can
allocate bandwidth to input/output pairs by prioritizing the switch ports and a
new hybrid buffer structure for ports connected to reconfigurable regions for
more efficient memory use. The switch is implemented for Xilinx Zynq SoC device
to work at 40 Gbps. Our simulation results demonstrate the benefits of the
proposed arbiter and the hybrid buffer structure.

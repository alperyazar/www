# Abstract

In this paper we propose ACCLOUD-MAN, a novel resource manager for heterogeneous
cloud data centers. In heterogeneous clouds a user request can be satisfied with
more than one physical resource alternative. Resource manager must decide which
resource alternative will be chosen, along with the decision of the server the
request will be assigned to. ACCLOUDMAN's resource management objective is to
reduce the power consumption of the cloud. Manager is modeled as an Integer
Linear Problem and is implemented on MATLAB, together with a simulation
platform. Simulation results show that the solution times are too long for
practical applications. Dividing requests into smaller groups is suggested to
improve the timings. It is seen that this method improves the timings with a
penalty in decision performance.

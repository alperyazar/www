# Abstract

In this paper, we propose a scalable on-chip packet switch architecture for
hardware accelerated cloud computing systems. Our proposed switch architecture
is implemented on the FPGA and interconnects reconfigurable regions, 40 Gbps
Ethernet interfaces and a PCIe interface. The switch fabric operates at line
speed to achieve scalability. We propose a new algorithm that grants access to
the fabric according to the allocated prioritization to input-output port pairs.
The switch is implemented on Xilinx Zynq 7000-SoC and can work at 40 Gbps rate.
Our simulation results show that our proposed algorithm achieves desired
prioritization without degrading the throughput.

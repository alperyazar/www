# Abstract

This paper describes the generalization of OpenStack cloud resource management
software to manage hardware resources other than the standard resources on the
servers. To this end, OpenStack resource data structure is updated and the Nova
project, which runs on the compute node, is rewritten so that it can run on
different hardware platforms without depending on the operating system.

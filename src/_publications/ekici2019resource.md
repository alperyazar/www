# Abstract

In this paper we propose ACCLOUD-MAN, a novel resource manager for heterogeneous
cloud data centers. In heterogeneous clouds a user request can be satisfied with
more than one physical resource alternative. That is, the resource manager must
decide which resource alternative will be chosen, along with the decision of the
server the request will be assigned to. ACCLOUD-MAN's resource management
objective is to reduce the power consumption of the cloud data center. To this
end, the manager is modeled as an integer linear programming problem and is
implemented in MATLAB, along with a cloud data center simulation platform.
Simulation results show that the proposed ACCLOUD-MAN outperforms existing
resource allocation methods such as Openstack.

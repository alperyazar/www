# Abstract

In this paper, we propose ACCLOUD (ACcelerated CLOUD) as a a novel architecture
for cloud data centers. ACCLOUD features FPGA cards which work with the cloud
servers or stand alone for hardware acceleration in the data plane. To this end,
FPGA reconfiGürable regions are virtualized and offered to the user together
with other cloud resources including CPU, memory or disk. The cloud control is
carried out within OpenStack framework incorporating the hardware resources. We
propose a novel resource management approach for ACCOUD which fulfills the user
requests by considering the tradeoffs between assignment of soft computing
resources and hardware accelerators.

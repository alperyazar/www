# Abstract

A method is presented for the selection of analysis window length, or the number
of input samples, for linear signal modeling without compromising the model
assumptions. It is assumed that the signal of interest lies in a known linear
space and noisy samples of the signal is provided. The goal is to use as many
signal samples as possible to mitigate the effect of noise without violating the
assumptions on the model. An application example is provided to illustrate the
suggested method.

# Abstract

In this paper, we propose CLOUDGEN workflow that produces synthetic workloads
for Infrastructure and Platform as a Service for the evaluation of resource
management approaches in cloud computing systems. To this end, CLOUDGEN
systematically processes and clusters records in a given workload trace and fits
distributions for different workload parameters within the clusters. Different
than the previous work, clustering is carried out to produce different virtual
machine types for achieving models that are suitable for producing
Infrastructure and Platform as a Service workload models. Finally, we
demonstrate CLOUDGEN by modeling recent Azure traces with enough detail to
enable researchers to use these models and generating synthetic traces that are
statistically similar to the Azure traces.

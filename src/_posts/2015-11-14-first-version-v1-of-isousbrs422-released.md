[I had announced]({% post_url 2014-12-23-new-project-isousbrs422 %}) my first
open source hardware project on my blog in December 2014. This is an open
source, isolated USB â†” RS-422/RS-485 converter board.

Today, I finished all jobs related to this project and published all necessary
files. I took approximately 1 year to finish it. It is very long time for such
project but I worked for my MSc thesis work almost all my spare time. After
finishing my thesis work, I was able to finish this project.

Finally, **I prepared 6 tutorial videos with total run time ~1.5 hours (!) for
makers.** It took lots of time, really. All files are also published. My first
hardware project is completed! Yay!

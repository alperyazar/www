*Dangerous Prototypes*

Vow! Another great news after [isoUSBRS422 is on EEVblog "Mailbag" (+my
comments)]({% post_url 2015-12-26-isousbrs422-is-on-eevblog-mailbag %}) post.
[Dangerous Prototypes](http://www.dangerousprototypes.com/) which is one of the
best sites about electronics and open source hardware projects is kind enough to
mention about [isoUSBRS422]({% link
_projects/isousbrs422.md %}) project.

Many thanks to DP. I am glad to see my project on such a reputable blog.

[2021-03-29 2021-04-04]

* (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§) Looks like we have a new foundation:
  [Open-Source FPGA Foundation](https://osfpga.org/) and their
  [repo](https://github.com/os-fpga). Domain registered on 2021-03-12. I don't
  know what they will do but it is good to see more open source movements on
  FPGA world.

* ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ Xilinx announced a SOM product: **Kria** It is a Zynq Ultrascale+ EV
  board (for now). There are also companies like Trenz, Enclustra making SOM
  boards. It looks like Xilinx decided to release its own SOM design. Of course,
  they emphasize AI applications. For now, only Kria K26 is avaliable with a
  starter kit but more SOMs are on way.

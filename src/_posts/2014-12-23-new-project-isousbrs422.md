I have just ordered PCBs of my new project: **isoUSBRS422**. It is an isolated
USB â†” RS422 board. I am very excited about process because it will be my first
(real) open source hardware (not OSHW licensed) and KiCad project. Hopefully, it
will work :)

Image at the top is created by Gerber files by [ZofzPCB]({% post_url
2014-12-21-zofzpcb %}) not a real picture. Hopefully, soldermask will be dark as
shown.

Some time ago, I saw a Italy map at silkscreen on bottom layer of one Arduino
board. So, I decided to put a Turkey map to see how it looks like, not for
nationalism. I hope, resolution of silkscreen layer will be good enough.

At that moment, it is in production stage at board house.

Stay tuned! :)

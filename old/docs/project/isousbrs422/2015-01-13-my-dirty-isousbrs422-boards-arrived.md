# My "Dirty" isoUSBRS422 Boards Just Arrived

Good news for my isoUSBRS422 project. PCBs ordered from [DirtyPCBs](https://dirtypcbs.com/) just arrived. They are not very "dirty". There are some misalignments for silk screen and soldermaks layers. But these are not seems to be problematic. Later, I will shot some photos under microscope inspection for drills, pads soldermask and silkscreen layers.

Here is the order history:

* **19.12.2014:** I uploaded Gerber files to DirtyPCBs.
* **21.12.2014:** Gerbers sent to board house.
* **24.12.2014:** Boards were shipped.
* **13.01.2015:** Boards arrived in Turkey.

I chose Hongkong Airmail for shipment which has an arriving time 1 to 8 weeks. But, I received my boards within third week (Turkey). I chose protopack. Board quantity is between 0 and 20 with mean value 10 for protopack option! :) Fortunately, I got 12 boards. Also black soldermask looks very cool. :)

Now for my isoUSBRS422 project, I will find some missing components. Unfortunately, I have neither a reflow (toaster) oven nor stencil for board. All parts will be soldered by hand. Couple of ICs and some passives larger than 0603 size, not a big deal.
